# Voice Picking Performance Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the performance of voice-picking systems (Vocollect, Lucas) using sample data to evaluate accuracy, pick rate, and productivity. It reflects real-world analytics performed in distribution centers transitioning from RF to voice technology.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare voice picking vs. RF picking performance.
- Identify productivity trends by shift, employee, and order type.
- Analyze error rates and training impact.
- Provide insights for labor planning and process improvement.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Sample picking datasets  

## 📊 Key Metrics
- Picks per hour  
- Error rate  
- Accuracy by employee  
- Productivity by shift  
- Training curve analysis
