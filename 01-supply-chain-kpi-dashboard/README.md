# Supply Chain KPI Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases a Power BI dashboard designed to monitor and improve warehouse operational performance. It focuses on key distribution KPIs such as throughput, picking accuracy, labor productivity, and on-time shipping. The dashboard is modeled after real-world reporting needs from large-scale distribution environments.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide leadership with real-time visibility into warehouse performance.
- Identify bottlenecks in picking, packing, and shipping workflows.
- Improve labor allocation and shift planning.
- Track accuracy and productivity across teams and order types.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- Power Query  
- DAX  
- SQL  
- Sample warehouse operational data (CSV)

## 📊 Key Features
- **Throughput Analysis:** Orders processed per hour/day.
- **Picking Accuracy:** Error rates by picker, shift, and order type.
- **Labor Productivity:** Units per labor hour (UPLH).
- **On-Time Shipping:** Percentage of orders shipped before cutoff.
- **Shift Comparison:** Performance variance across AM/PM shifts.
