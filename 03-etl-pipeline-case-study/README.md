# ETL Pipeline Case Study

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to consolidate data from multiple warehouse systems (WMS, ERP, voice picking, labor management) into a centralized reporting environment.

It is inspired by real-world ETL workflows used in distribution analytics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate data extraction from operational systems.
- Clean, standardize, and transform raw data.
- Load data into a structured reporting database.
- Improve data quality and reduce manual reporting time.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas)
- SQL
- ETL concepts (batch processing)
- Data validation techniques

## 🔄 ETL Flow
1. **Extract:** Pull data from CSV, SQL, or API sources.  
2. **Transform:**  
   - Clean missing values  
   - Standardize timestamps  
   - Normalize product and location codes  
   - Join datasets  
3. **Load:** Insert into reporting tables for dashboards and analytics.
